GUIDING PRINCIPLES ( THESE DO CHANGE )
> default:flexible
> map the rabbit hole.
> design is a religion.
> put questions to nature.
> simplification is smarter.
> endurance is fueled by curiosity.
> eliminate meaningless superlatives.
> absolute linearity is like flatearth.
> design is a definable root and route.
> transcend from disruption into harmony.
> state what you do not know. work from here.
> hatred of self technology is self-defeating.
> question, rotate, or relinquish your current truths.
> asking the dumb question creates less misinformation.
> to be human is to invent/implement things of the mind.
> winning will be determined by intensity of the pursuit.
> design is deliverance of potency @ some scale within some domain.
```

```
METHODOLOGY ( DESIGN APPROACH )
1. state the problem ( point of inspiration )
    > list what you currently know
    > ask a dumb question
2. define a set of hypotheses
    > keep them linked to the problem
    > if not linked to problem, store in a new set ( come back later )
3. design tests and experiments relative to the hypotheses set.
    > examine validity of tests
    > tests need range ( simple to more complex )
4. document results of testing, experimentation.
    > log:
        - predicted results
        - actual results
            + hypothesis sustaining
            + hypothesis contradicting
5. provide an account of detailied observations.
    > qualitative ( feelings, encounters, context )
    > quantitative ( hard numbers and metrics )
6. make conclusions.
    > have follow-up questions.
    > and folow-up actions.
```

``` 
BUSINESS MODEL
channels
> establish a media platform.
> distribute directly to audience.
> publish perspectives ( self, external interests ).

cost structure
> allocate most budget for creation.
> bring rapid prototyping in-house.
> reduce cost of advertising/marketing via automation, expert knowledge.
> reduce cost of customization via modernity â€” software, additive manufacturing, etc.

customer relationships
> implement end-audience feedback into iterations.
> provide end-audience with means to customize applications ( products ).

key activites
> design.preview.ship
> produce.refine.sell
> design.develop.explore

key partners
> spirited customers
> symbioitc (non-co-dependent) enterprises.
> instiutions neo&& values ( and vice-versa )

revenue stream
> avoid industry co-dependence.
> develop repeatable streams of income.
> cannot afford to produce? license concept.
> monetize the model ( and its components ).
> any one production is sold in a multitude of ways.
> completed projects create paid consultancy/comission opportunities.

value proposistion
> adapt as needed.
> robust niches > irrelevant niches
> completed projects builds neo&& ecosystem.
> routine sweeps for single points of failure.
