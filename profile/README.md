## ü§î What is Neo Interface Technology & Design (Neo ITD)?
An interface-spirited foundation using design and engineering as a means to research, develop, transact, and implement expressible elements. 

_Note: Interface is not defined as a Graphical User Interface (GUI), but by its dictionary meaning of, The point of interconnection or contact between entities.__
_Another note: Neo's "Expressible elements" are presented as functional prototypes, products, and applications.__

## ùå≠ Business Model
* Bring rapid prototyping in-house.
* Combine the artisanal with modern manufacturing and production tools.
* Deliver variety and uniqueness via micro productions.
* Eliminate the cost of customization via modern tools ( design software, additive manufacturing machines ).
* Maintain a public and open-source archive. 
* Publish our own perspectives.
* Use momentum of realized projects as opportunity to create consulting and commission opportunities.

## ü•∑üèæ Design Disciplines
* Content 
* Data 
* Hardware
* Interface
* Product
* Research
* Software

## üë£ Guiding Principles
Guiding principles are our foundations to form a perspective on how to work, exist.

* Absolute Linearity is FlatEarth.
* Ask the dumb questions first.
* Be Flexible by default.
* Design and Engineering are not separate. Neo views them as one.
* Design as an exploration service to support || simplify || amplify current and emerging infrastructures.
* Design is an implemented religion.
* Design is not prettification, but deliverance of potency at || to || within a given domain.
* Endurance is fueled by curiosity.
* Eliminate meaningless superlatives.
* Function is an aesthetic. 
* Give up your current truths.
* Hatred of technology is self defeating.
* Mass education is mass hypnosis.
* Put questions to nature.
* Self define hierarchy. And re-evaluate often. 
* Scribe y/our Design Singularity.
* State what you know. And what you do not know. Work from here.
* To be human is to invent/implement things of the mind
* View Interface from its base definition, "a point of interconnection between entities."
* "Winning" will be defined by the intensity of the pursuit.


## üåè Interfaces
Interfaces represent the macro genre. Think of these as domains. And within each domain exists projects, products, content. 

* Communication
* Conservation
* Hygience
* Media
* Pleasure
* Reformation
* Wealth

## üë®üèæ‚Äçüç≥ Methodology
We utilize the Scientific Method for introducing and exploring problems. The goal is that these turn into detailed, focused, precise, and viable projects.

1. State the problem.
    - State what you currently know. Ask a dumb question. No need to start off down a path of misinformation.
2. Define an array of hypotheses. These need to be linked to the problem.
3. Design tests and experiments relative to the set of hypotheses.
4. Document the results of testing and experimentation.
    - Predicted results
    - Actual results ( includes unintended effects )
    	+ Label as hypothesis sustaining.
    	+ Or label as hypthesis contradicting.
5. Provide an account of detailed observations.
    - Qualitative
    - Quantitative
6. Make conclusions based on this method. Include follow-up actions and questions.
